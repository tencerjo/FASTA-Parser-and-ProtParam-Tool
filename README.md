Built on Anaconda 2.6.0, Python 3.11.7

This FASTA Parser tools script looks for text starting with ">" and grabs the amino acid sequence below it until two line breaks are detected (rather than just looking for the next ">".

The v0_5 script will take a text file the user edits in the code.

The v0_54 script will search for a .fasta file in a dir input by the user.

The script then uses BioPython to calculate various biochemical properties and writes them to a csv file along with the sequence name, original sequence, and the sequence with an appended C-terminus sequence (used for biochemical calculation)
